# ChocAnProject
My Chocoholics project for my CS200 Software Engineering and Design Class

Project Description - ChocAn Data Processing Software

I am thrilled to share insights into the comprehensive data processing software that our team developed for Chocoholics Anonymous (ChocAn) as part of our Software Engineering and Design class. This collaborative effort involved a team of six individuals, with my primary responsibilities centering around the creation of the Member Report, Provider Report, Manager Report, and the development of the TerminalGUI.java class, which serves as the graphical user interface (GUI) for the software.

**Overview:**
Our software addresses the unique needs of ChocAn, an organization dedicated to assisting individuals addicted to chocolate through consultations and treatments with healthcare professionals. Members subscribe to ChocAn, receiving a personalized card with a unique nine-digit member number for accessing services.

**Functionality:**
The software facilitates member validation, service billing, and generates comprehensive reports for both members and providers. Upon a service being provided, providers use the ChocAn terminal to enter necessary details, including the member number, date of service, service code, and optional comments. The software validates this information and prompts providers to verify the service details.

**Data Management:**
A robust record-keeping system is integral to our software. It captures critical information such as the date and time of the transaction, provider and member details, service code, and comments. Additionally, the software calculates and displays the fee for the service, aiding providers in billing ChocAn accurately.

**Reports and Billing:**
The software automates the generation of weekly reports for both members and providers. Members receive detailed reports of services provided, while providers receive reports of their billed services, including a summary of consultations and total fees. These reports are crucial for verification and transparency.

**Integration with Acme Accounting Services:**
Our software seamlessly integrates with Acme Accounting Services, a third-party organization responsible for managing ChocAn membership fees. This collaboration ensures timely updates of financial records and the suspension/reinstatement of members based on payment status.

**Simulation and Acceptance Testing:**
To meet contract requirements, our software allows for simulation of data from a provider's terminal via keyboard input. The graphical interface accurately mimics the terminal display, meeting the acceptance test criteria.

**Conclusion:**
This project showcases our team's proficiency in software engineering and design, providing ChocAn with a robust, user-friendly, and efficient data processing system. My contribution to the Member Report, Provider Report, Manager Report, and the TerminalGUI.java class reflects my dedication to creating a comprehensive solution for ChocAn's unique requirements.
